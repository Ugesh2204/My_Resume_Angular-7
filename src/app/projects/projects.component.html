                          <p>  My Goal for this project was to implement functionality like
                                Authentication and Authorization using IDENTITY SERVER,
                                where a user can Register, login/logout.

                                I have included role Management which allows admin to perform certain task like Read, create, delete functionality 
                                or Accept/Reject any user request.
            .
                                
                                This project was built using Code first approche Entity framework method  where i have split parts into layers such as Business logic layer (BBL),
                                Business Object Layer (BOL),Data Acesss Layer (DAL) and the UI. Each component communicates to each other individually by  an IRepository  pattern
